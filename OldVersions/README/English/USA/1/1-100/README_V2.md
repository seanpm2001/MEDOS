## MEDOS commercial

The MEDOS commercial was an old project within this project for a commercial for the product.

The commercial uses audio files of Stephen Hawking [generated by Lingojam](https://lingojam.com/StephenHawkingVoiceGenerator) and talks about the future of [dos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) over old operating systems and [286 computers (NON HTTPS LINK WARNING)](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/userdata/images/large/56/32/product-75632.jpg). The commercial is outdated.

***

## Spelling errors

This project has a few spelling errors that I cloned to GitHub. I didn't fix these, as they were originally like that in the original project, and I can't change it at all, as I want to have a complete archive with no differences (other than things added, or files I can't upload)

The only word that was misspelled in a folder/file name is Armenian (spelled as `Armanian`)

***
